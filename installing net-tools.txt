Inside the new container we can't run the ifconfig command because the package in which ifconfig command reside is not installed . The package name is net-tools.
Go inside the container:
# cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
check the repos
# ls
Go to directory from where you come
# cd -
Install net-tools software
# yum install net-tools 
Now the ifconfig command works
# ifconfig
